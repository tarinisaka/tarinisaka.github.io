      I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher at [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en), where I am part of the [Chair for Security and Privacy of Ubiquitous Systems](https://informatik.rub.de/en/research/chairs/ubisys/). I am also a member of the [Horst Görtz Institute for IT Security](https://hgi.rub.de/en) and Cluster of Excellence [CASA](https://casa.rub.de/en/). 
      
      I am a new postdoc, so still figuring stuff out :)

      Previously, I was a PhD candidate at the University of Edinburgh with the [Artificial Intelligence and its Applications Institute](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/aiai). 
      I was a member of the [Technology Usability Lab in Privacy and Security (TULIPS)](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/tulips/) and the [Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) Lab](https://edi-chai-lab.github.io/chai-lab-site/). 
      My PhD research revolved around the critical area of organizational phishing management, where I utilized the advancements of AI and NLP to develop intelligent tools for strengthening defences against cyber threats. 
      By integrating human-computer interaction (HCI) principles, I created user-oriented solutions that empowered organizations to safeguard against phishing attacks more effectively. 
      My amazing PhD supervisors are  [Dr. Nadin Kokciyan](http://www.nadinkokciyan.com/)  and  [Dr. Kami Vaniea](https://vaniea.com/).
